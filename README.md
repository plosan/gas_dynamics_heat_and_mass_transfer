## gas_dynamics_heat_and_mass_transfer
Gas Dynamics and Heat and Mass Transfer is a 6th semester course in Aerospace Engineering Technologies. In it, we do an in-depth study of the three
ways of heat transfer and combine it with fluid mechanics. Since the equations that arise in these subjects are PDEs with complex boundary conditions,
we cannot expect to obtain analytical solutions. Only in few cases with many simplifications and simmetries, we have an analytical expression for
the temperature distribution.
